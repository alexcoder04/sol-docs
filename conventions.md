# Conventions

## Function naming

Do not name your functions with an `_` and do not overwrite any of these. These are reserved for sol internal use.

*Exception*: you want to overwrite the `_draw(gc)` function for a **custom** component that inherited from an existing base component.

## Component naming

Components start with a capital letter and are camel-case. The name of the file is the name of the component.
